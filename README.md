# data-science-mini-projects
Welcome to my collection of small-scale and exploratory data science projects.  
Each project in this repository focuses on a specific aspect of the data science workflow â€” from data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to basic modeling and visualization.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

These projects demonstrate:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing techniques  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
